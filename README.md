Project Title: Family Tree Management System in C

Project Overview:
The Family Tree Management System is a comprehensive software application developed in C to manage and analyze family relationships. It allows users to build a family tree by adding, deleting, and searching for family members. The system provides a structured and intuitive interface for displaying family members and offers detailed statistics about the family, such as gender counts and age group categorizations.

Key Features:

Add Family Members: Users can add new members to the family tree with details including name, gender, and age.
Display Family Tree: The system displays the entire family tree using an inorder traversal, showcasing the hierarchical structure of family members.
Gender Count: Users can retrieve the count of male and female family members separately.
Search for Family Members: The system allows users to search for a family member by name and provides detailed information about the member if found.
Delete Family Members: Users can remove a family member from the tree by specifying the member's name.
Age Group Categorization: The system categorizes family members into three age groups:
Children (0-17 years)
Adults (18-49 years)
Elderly (50+ years)
It provides the count of family members in each age group, allowing for demographic analysis of the family.
Technical Details:

Language: C
Data Structure: Binary Search Tree (BST) for organizing family members based on age.
Memory Management: Dynamic memory allocation for flexible handling of family member records.
Algorithm: Recursive functions for tree traversal (inorder), searching, deletion, and counting operations.
